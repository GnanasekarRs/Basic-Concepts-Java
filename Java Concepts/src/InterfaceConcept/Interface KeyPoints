Key points: Here are the key points to remember about interfaces:

1) We can’t instantiate an interface in java. That means we cannot create the object of an interface

2) Interface provides full abstraction as none of its methods have body. On the other hand abstract class provides partial abstraction as it can have abstract and concrete(methods with body) methods both.

3) implements keyword is used by classes to implement an interface.

4) While providing implementation in class of any method of an interface, it needs to be mentioned as public.

5) Class that implements any interface must implement all the methods of that interface, else the class should be declared abstract.

6) Interface cannot be declared as private, protected or transient.

7) All the interface methods are by default abstract and public.

8) Variables declared in interface are public, static and final by default.

interface Try
{
   int a=10;
   public int a=10;
   public static final int a=10;
   final int a=10;
   static int a=0;
}
All of the above statements are identical.

9) Interface variables must be initialized at the time of declaration otherwise compiler will throw an error.

interface Try
{
      int x;//Compile-time error
}
Above code will throw a compile time error as the value of the variable x is not initialized at the time of declaration.

10) Inside any implementation class, you cannot change the variables declared in interface because by default, they are public, static and final. Here we are implementing the interface “Try” which has a variable x. When we tried to set the value for variable x we got compilation error as the variable x is public static final by default and final variables can not be re-initialized.

class Sample implements Try
{
  public static void main(String args[])
  {
     x=20; //compile time error
  }
}
11) An interface can extend any interface but cannot implement it. Class implements interface and interface extends interface.

12) A class can implement any number of interfaces.

13) If there are two or more same methods in two interfaces and a class implements both interfaces, implementation of the method once is enough.

interface A
{
   public void aaa();
}
interface B
{
   public void aaa();
}
class Central implements A,B
{
   public void aaa()
   {
        //Any Code here
   }
   public static void main(String args[])
   {
        //Statements
    }
}
14) A class cannot implement two interfaces that have methods with same name but different return type.

interface A
{
   public void aaa();
}
interface B
{
   public int aaa();
}

class Central implements A,B
{

   public void aaa() // error
   {
   }
   public int aaa() // error
   {
   }
   public static void main(String args[])
   {

   }
}
15) Variable names conflicts can be resolved by interface name.

interface A
{
    int x=10;
}
interface B
{
    int x=100;
}
class Hello implements A,B
{
    public static void Main(String args[])
    {
       /* reference to x is ambiguous both variables are x
        * so we are using interface name to resolve the 
        * variable
        */
       System.out.println(x); 
       System.out.println(A.x);
       System.out.println(B.x);
    }
}
Advantages of interface in java:
Advantages of using interfaces are as follows:

Without bothering about the implementation part, we can achieve the security of implementation
In java, multiple inheritance is not allowed, however you can use interface to make use of it as you can implement more than one interface.
