Static Variables:
1) When we declared Static Variables then it can be accessed directly inside in main class
2) Static variable is Purely class base,even creating obj to call static Variable it will waste the obj.
3) Here Static variable not based on Object its based on Class

Static Methods:
1) Static Method can access only static variables.
2) Directly Access Static Methods without Creating the OBJECTS.
3) OR we can access By classname.methodName.

Static class:
1) Static class is not possible in java, we have to make nested static class to achieve
2) Static class can have both static methods and non static method
